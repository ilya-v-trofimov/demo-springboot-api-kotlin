#Person and Vehicle API Project

##Potential improvements:
Following improvements could be implemented to further improve quality and performance of the project:
- Add Dockerfile to containerise application for CI/CD and/or local development
- Add checkstyle
- Use lighter `@WebMvcTest` tests to test controllers separately from heavier e2e tests (currently implemented with `@SpringBootTest`)
